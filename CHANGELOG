0.1.4:
----------------
* fixing bug if we get a uniform distribution with duplicates and try to sample_unique for number
  of samples that's between # of distinct values and total # of values (had infinite loop :( )
* changed behavior when requesting to sample_unique with larger number than the total number
  of values in a distribution. instead of raising exception, just return unique set of all the
  valid values. this shouldn't break any existing implementations unless someone was depending
  on the exceptions being raised (that would be bad form).
